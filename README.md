# MCM-Killer Agent 🤖

> **Project Goal**: Building an Autonomous Multi-Agent AI System to conquer the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM).

**MCM-Killer** is an active research project using Claude Code's multi-agent architecture to fully automate the MCM competition process—from reading the problem to producing an O-Prize quality paper.

| Agent | Role | Model | Key Responsibility |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Director** | Orchestrator | - | Coordinates workflow, verifies outputs |
| **Reader** | Problem Analyst | Opus | Extracts ALL requirements from PDF |
| **Researcher** | Knowledge Miner | Sonnet | Searches past O-Prize papers |
| **Modeler** | Math Designer | Opus | Designs models for each requirement |
| **Coder** | Implementer | Sonnet | Writes and executes Python code |
| **Writer** | Paper Author | Opus | Writes 25-page LaTeX paper |
| **Advisor** | Quality Reviewer | Opus | Compares against O-Prize standards |

## � Lessons Learned

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Discovered

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Agent Hallucination** | Subagent returned "0 tool uses" but claimed success | Added strict "0 tools = FAILURE" enforcement |
| **Wrong Problem Solved** | Agent guessed problem content instead of reading PDF | Added CRITICAL warnings to force tool usage |
| **Single-Agent Failure** | Director did work itself instead of delegating | Made CLAUDE.md FORBID solo work |
| **Shallow Analysis** | Only 2/6 requirements addressed | Added requirement coverage matrix |
| **Wrong Format** | Markdown instead of 25-page LaTeX | Specified exact format in writer.md |
| **File Deletion Risk** | Source files potentially deleted during operation | Added .gitignore, recommend read-only permissions |

### ✅ Best Practices Established

1. **Always verify output files exist** before proceeding to next phase
2. **Compare against past O-Prize papers** for quality benchmarking
3. **Use Advisor agent** as final quality gate before completion
4. **Maintain Git history** for recovery and debugging
5. **Protect source data** with read-only permissions

## 🧪 Data Strategy: Training vs Testing

| Dataset | Years | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Training** | 2020 - 2024 | Knowledge Base, Few-Shot Examples |
| **Blind Test** | 2025 | Hold-out set for Agent evaluation |

## 📋 Prerequisites

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Python** | 3.10+ | Code execution, venv |
| **Claude Code** | Latest | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **uv / uvx** | Latest | MCP server management |
| **LaTeX** | TeX Live / MiKTeX | Paper compilation (optional) |

### Python Libraries (installed in venv)

```
pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib statsmodels seaborn
```

### MCP Server: Docling (REQUIRED)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Claude's built-in PDF reader causes hallucinations.** You MUST use `docling-mcp` for accurate PDF extraction.

Install uv (if not already installed):
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Linux/macOS
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Start Docling MCP Server (in a separate terminal)

```powershell
cd c:\Projects\MCM-killer
uvx --from docling-mcp docling-mcp-server --transport sse --port 33333
```

> Keep this terminal running throughout the session. The MCP server provides PDF text extraction for @reader, @researcher, and @advisor agents.

### 2. Navigate to workspace

```powershell
cd c:\Projects\MCM-killer\workspace\2025_C
```

### 3. Start Claude Code

```powershell
claude
# Or with auto-approval for faster iteration:
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### 4. Run multi-agent workflow

```
Read CLAUDE.md. You are the Director. 
Start the multi-agent workflow by calling @reader first.
```

## 🛡️ Data Protection

To prevent accidental deletion of source files:

```powershell
# Set read-only on important directories
attrib +R "problems and results\*" /S
attrib +R "student paper\*" /S
```

## � Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1**: Data Collection & Standardization
- [x] **Phase 2**: Multi-Agent Architecture Design
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Successful Problem Solving
- [ ] **Phase 4**: O-Prize Quality Validation
